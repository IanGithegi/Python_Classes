## Palindrome

Find the length of the longest substring in the given string s that is the same in reverse.
As an example, if the input was “I like racecars that go fast”, the substring (racecar) length would be 7.
If the length of the input string is 0, return value must be 0.
Example:

"a" -> 1
"aab" -> 2
"abcde" -> 1
"zzbaabcd" -> 4
"" -> 0

## Palindrome Products

Write a program that can detect palindrome products in a given range.

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome
made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 x 99.
