# Of Strings and words

The packages here are challenges that involve string manipulation.

Each package contains a README.md file with details of the challenge and clues to solving the problem. Additionally tests are included with the format `test_<CHALLENGE_PROBLEM>.py`.

Tests can be run with pytest.

```bash
$ py.test test_<CHALLENGE_PROBLEM>.py
```

or by running the test file

```bash
$ python test_<CHALLENGE_PROBLEM>.py
```
